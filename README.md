Jean Coutu, supermodel, influencer in the small animal kingdom and expert at waking up exactly at 6:00am everyday for my breakfast which is ALWAYS late. I started my career as a treat tester, and have since discovered my passion for modelling, as it's the best of both worlds since companies send me free treats if I model with their products.

##

This is my second project working on a web site deducted to my pet bunny Jean Coutu and his cuteness while displaying my skills as well his.

You can check my first project I have done <a href="https://github.com/Ckrcok/Connect-Four-In-Space"> In this repository </a> Connect-Four In Space
